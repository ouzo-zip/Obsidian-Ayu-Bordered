# Ayu Bordered for Obsidian

A port of the Ayu Bordered theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). This theme is designed to look very similar to the [Ayu theme for VS Code](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu). It supports both light and dark modes.

## Features

* **Accurate Palette:** Uses the canonical Ayu Dark and Light hex codes.
* **Bordered UI:** Distinct borders around panes and sidebars, mimicking the VS Code "Bordered" variant.
* **Syntax Highlighting:** Custom colouring for code blocks (Python, JS, etc.) to match Ayu's specific syntax spec (Green strings, Orange keywords).
* **Native Fonts:** Respects your custom font settings in Obsidian while enforcing monospace for code.
